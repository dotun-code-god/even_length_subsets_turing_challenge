Coding Challenge: Given a set of numbers k, find all subsets of k such that each has an even number of integers, and then return the sum
of all these subsets.
A subset is a contiguous subsequenceof k
Example: 
  Input: k = [1,4,2,5]
  Output: 30
  Explanation: The possible subarrays of k and their sums are:
  [1,4] = 5
  [4,2] = 6
  [2,5] = 7
  [1,4,2,5] = 12
  The sum of all subarrays = 5 + 6 + 7 + 12 = 30
