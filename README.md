## Coding Challenge: 
  <p>Given a set of numbers k, find all subsets of k such that each has an <strong style="text-decoration:underline">even</strong> number of integers, and then return the sum
    of all these subsets. 
  <br>
    A subset is a contiguous subsequenceof k
  </p> <br>

## Example: 
  Input: k = [1,4,2,5] <br>
  Output: 30  <br>
  Explanation: The possible subarrays of k and their sums are:  <br>
  [1,4] = 5  <br>
  [4,2] = 6  <br>
  [2,5] = 7  <br>
  [1,4,2,5] = 12  <br>
  The sum of all subarrays = 5 + 6 + 7 + 12 = 30

  <br>

## Constraints: 
 *  1 <= k.length <= 100  <br>
 *  1 <= k[i] <= 1000  <br>
